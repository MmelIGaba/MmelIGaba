# Mmeli Gabriel Dyantyi

**Systems Developer | Cloud Engineer | DevOps Engineer | Full-Stack Builder**  
Applied Mathematics & Computer Science Student  

I design and build **modular, scalable, production-ready systems** with a strong emphasis on clarity, operational robustness, and intentional design. My work sits at the intersection of software engineering, cloud infrastructure, and mathematical reasoning — transforming complex requirements into clean, deployable systems.

## What I Do

- **Full-stack systems engineering**: Designing backend services and APIs and integrating them with performant, modern frontends.  
- **Cloud & DevOps engineering**: Containerized deployments with Docker and Kubernetes, automated CI/CD pipelines, and secure infrastructure practices.  
- **System architecture**: Building future-proof systems with clear boundaries, replaceable components, and strong contracts between layers.  
- **Operational debugging**: Rapid diagnosis of build, configuration, networking, and runtime failures across environments.  
- **Mathematical problem-solving**: Translating abstract models, constraints, and logic into deterministic, reliable code.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**  
React, Vite, TailwindCSS, React Native, Ionic / Angular  

**Backend**  
Node.js, Python, Go, ASP.NET, Spring Boot  

**Cloud & DevOps**  
Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines, AWS  

**Databases**  
MongoDB, PostgreSQL  

**Other**  
Advanced API integrations, authentication & authorization flows, secure credential management

## Current Focus

- Preparing for **AWS Cloud Infrastructure Certification**  
- Delivering **modular microservices** for multi-channel integrations (WhatsApp, Twitter/X, Facebook)  
- Resolving **SSL/TLS connectivity and networking issues** with MongoDB Atlas  
- Hardening repositories by **eliminating exposed secrets** and enforcing secure credential workflows  
- Exploring **advanced ML workflows** and agentic system frameworks

## Design Philosophy

Minimal, high-contrast interfaces.  
Black foundations with bold orange accents.

Every artifact — codebase, README, UI, or technical document — should be immediately recognizable: **no clutter, maximum signal, intentional structure**.
