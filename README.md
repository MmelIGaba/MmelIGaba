# 👋 Hi, I'm Mmeli Gabriel Dyantyi

Systems Developer | Cloud Engineer | DevOps Engineer | Full‑stack Builder  
Applied Math & Computer Science Student  
Architect of modular, scalable, production‑ready systems with a focus on clarity and bold design.

---

## What I Do
- **Full‑stack integration**: Building backend APIs and connecting them to dynamic React frontends.  
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions, and secure credential management.  
- **System architecture**: Designing modular, future‑proof systems with clean boundaries and replaceable layers.  
- **Debugging wizardry**: Diagnosing and fixing config, build, and operational issues at speed.  
- **Mathematical reasoning**: Translating abstract rules into robust, convergent code.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS, ReactNative, IONIC/Angular  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python, Go, ASP.NET, Springboot
- **Cloud & Ops**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, CI/CD, AWS 
- **Databases**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, 
- **Other**: Advanced API integrations, secure credential workflows

## Current Focus
- AWS Cloud Infrastructure Certification
- Delivering modular microservices for multi‑channel integrations (WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook).  
- Resolving SSL/TLS connectivity issues with MongoDB Atlas.  
- Scrubbing secrets from repos and implementing secure credential workflows.  
- Exploring advanced ML workflows and agentic frameworks.

## Design Philosophy
Minimal, high‑contrast interfaces with bold orange accents on black.  
Every artifact — code, README, UI, document — should be instantly recognizable as mine: no clutter, maximum signal.
